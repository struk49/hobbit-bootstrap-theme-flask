        "description": " Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in hisyouth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated inthe Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate ofMoria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the groundas a shield, he gained the epithet 'Oakenshield,' which would remain with him even in death.[2]",
